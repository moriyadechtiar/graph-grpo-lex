        "- Phase 1 (global async) — Extract edges per clause with high-throughput LLM calls\n",
        "  - Edges include: `IS_PART_OF`, `DEFINES`, `USES`, `CONTAINS`, `REFERENCES`, `MENTION_PARTY`.\n",
        "  - Uses global concurrency across all contracts/clauses to fully utilize your paid rate limits.\n",
        "- Phase 1.5 — Consolidate and deduplicate edges\n",
        "  - Produces both a complete graph of nodes, and edges.\n",
        "- Metrics & QA — Compute dataset-level metrics, visualize distributions, and identify outliers\n",

All such taxes or duties shall be for the account of Distributor and any such taxes or duties required to be paid or collected by NETGEAR shall be paid by Distributor to NETGEAR unless Distributor provides NETGEAR with a valid certificate of exemption acceptable to the appropriate taxing or governmental authority. E. PAYMENT. Except as may be specifically authorized in writing by NETGEAR, and subject to NETGEAR's continuing approval of Distributor's credit status and financial condition, Distributor will pay NETGEAR for all Products ordered by Distributor within [*] of the date the corresponding invoice is issued by NETGEAR. The foregoing notwithstanding, the parties agree that payment for the initial order placed by Distributor under this Agreement shall be due and payable within [*] of the date the corresponding invoice is issued by NETGEAR. NETGEAR, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to specify, and to change from time to time, Distributor's credit line and payment terms. All payments are to be made in U.S. dollars. Payment for shipments made outside of the United States shall be made by wire transfer in accordance with wire transfer procedures provided by NETGEAR. If at any time Distributor is delinquent in the payment of any invoice, exceeds the credit line established by NETGEAR, or is otherwise in breach of the Agreement, NETGEAR may, in its discretion, withhold shipment (including partial shipments) of any order or may require Distributor to pay cash on delivery for further shipments.

Unless otherwise instructed by Distributor, NETGEAR will ship Products ordered by Distributor using the method and carrier specified in Distributor's then current Routing Guide, as may be amended from time to time by written notice from Distributor. The version of the Routing Guide which is in force on the Effective Date of this Agreement is attached to and made a part of this Agreement as Exhibit 2. Distributor is responsible for all freight, handling, insurance and other transportation charges, and agrees to pay all such charges if separately identified on NETGEAR's invoice. NETGEAR will ship freight collect, uninsured, if so instructed by Distributor's order. B. CANCELLATION AND RESCHEDULING. Distributor may not cancel or reschedule any order, in whole or in part, less than five business days prior to the corresponding shipment date specified in NETGEAR's order acknowledgment.\"}}}\n",

This Agreement and the license granted herein shall remain effective until terminated. Customer may terminate this Agreement and the license at any time by destroying all copies of Software including any Documentation. Customer's rights under this Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from Cisco if Customer fails to comply with any provision of this Agreement. Upon termination, Customer shall destroy all copies of Software and Documentation in its possession or control. Customer Records. Customer grants to Cisco and its independent accountants the right to examine Customer's books, records and accounts during Customer's normal business hours to verify compliance with this Agreement. In the event such audit discloses non-compliance with this Agreement, Customer shall promptly pay to Cisco the appropriate license fees. Export. Software, including technical data, may be subject to U.S. export control laws, including the U.S. Export Administration Act and its associated regulations, and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. Customer agrees to comply strictly with all such regulations and acknowledges that it has the responsibility to obtain licenses to export, re-export, or import Software.

Each Party shall initially appoint up to three (3) representatives (or their designees) to the JSC, excluding the Alliance Manager of each Party who will attend JSC meetings in a non- voting capacity. Each such JSC representative of a Party will have sufficient seniority within such Party to make decisions arising within the scope of the JSC's responsibilities. The Parties' initial representatives to the JSC will be provided to each other Party within thirty (30) days after the Effective Date. The JSC may change its size from time to time by mutual consent of its members. Each Party may replace its JSC representatives at any time upon written notice to the other Party; provided, however, that neither Party may replace a representative on the JSC with an individual with lower seniority without the approval of the other Party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The JSC shall meet at least two times each Calendar Year, and at least one such JSC meeting shall be in person/ face-to-face with alternating locations (for in person/ face-to-face meetings only), unless otherwise agreed in writing by both Parties. Each Party may invite up to three (3) of its own employees, and the JSC may invite other non-members, to participate in the discussions and meetings of the JSC, provided that such participants shall have no voting authority at the JSC. The JSC shall have two (2) co- chairpersons, one from each Party. The role of the co-chairpersons shall be to convene and preside at meetings of the JSC. The Alliance Managers shall work with the co-chairpersons to prepare and circulate agendas and to ensure the preparation of minutes. The co- chairpersons shall have no additional powers or rights beyond those held by the other JSC representatives.\"}}}\n",

In order to assist Miltenyi with its capacity, procurement and production planning, and as a general framework for forecasting Bellicum's orders of Miltenyi Products (where more specific parameters may be set forth in a given Module), Bellicum agrees to provide Miltenyi with rolling forecasts of Bellicum's (and its Subcontractors' and Licensees') anticipated quantity requirements for Miltenyi Products in the Forecast Territory during the Term of this Agreement, in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.1 (each, a \\\"Forecast\\\"). There is no binding forecasting obligation for Research Grade Products, except (if applicable) as otherwise explicitly agreed in a Module. Any modified forecasting terms and conditions for a particular Bellicum Product or Bellicum Program that supplement this Article 5 will be set forth in the Module applicable to that Bellicum Product or Bellicum Program. All of the Forecasts provided under this Agreement will break down the demand of Miltenyi Products on a product-by-product (expressed in number of units) and manufacturing country-by-manufacturing country basis (i.e., Forecast Territory only) and substantially follow the mutually agreed Miltenyi forecast sheet, as attached hereto in Exhibit C 1-3. All Forecasts provided by Bellicum will be good faith estimates of Bellicum's anticipated quantity requirements for Miltenyi Products during the relevant period. Bellicum agrees to use [...***...] in preparing all Forecasts provided hereunder to minimize variances between Forecasts. Each Forecast shall be duly signed by an authorized representative of Bellicum (or Bellicum's designee on behalf of Bellicum) and submitted in writing to Miltenyi, by mail, email or facsimile, and shall supersede prior Forecasts to the extent the Forecast overlaps with prior Forecasts.\"}}}\n",
